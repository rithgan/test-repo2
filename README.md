# Things left and the way to do

1. Make product List draggable. This can be used using combination of css transform property. Easier way will be use to react-draggable component.
2. Select functionality of products using checkbox. Products should be added/removed from an array on click.  I have made input type="checkbox"  controllable but yet to add selected state. Could have saved time using external package called rc-checkbox
3. This feature is depended on 2. Count the number of selected products and add those in product list component
4. Add variant(show/hide) section in product list. Also dependent on 2. 
5. Add pagination on scroll. Can implement infinte scroll using scroll event listener. Simple pagination can be added on click of button

# Additional things

1. CSS could be refined to match more exactly to the desktop designs and make functional in mobile and tab view
2. Add backdrop to modal for ui purpose
